          <p>
          ATD Research and Consultancy LTD are experts in gap analysis, service
          evaluation, service re-design and best practice recommendations.  We
          support our clients to review their existing provisions, highlight
          what’s working and where improvements need to be made.  We provide
          objective, independent and informed approaches to deliver the best
          outcomes for providers and service-users. We can qualitatively
          evaluate the impact of new services or make suggestions about where
          new services may need to be considered or implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our expertise is in consulting service-users and those most affected
          by health, justice and social issues; translating findings into
          pragmatic recommendations for service delivery, practice and policy.
          We provide cost-effective, evidence based ideas to support identified
          cohorts with a high social return on investment.

            <h2>Training</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
          ATD Research and Consultancy LTD provide specialist training
          on motivating substance misusing offenders based on extensive
          research and work with this cohort.  The training advances the use of
          traditional recovery models and tools by encouraging consideration of
          quality of motivation, rather than its mere presence or absence. It
          considers how psychological frameworks can create spaces and
          environments that allow intrinsic motivation to flourish.
          </p>
          <p>
          Other areas of training are available upon request e.g. using
          forensic psychology to inform therapeutic environments, working with
          female offenders, mental health awareness training.  Please let us
          know your staff needs and we will be more than happy to discuss
          a bespoke package with you.
